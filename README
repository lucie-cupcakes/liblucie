C Library for my projects.

Read the file liblucie.h for definitions and documentation about each function.

For using it in your project, I recommend you use git submodules:

cd my_project
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/lucie-cupcakes/liblucie
git add liblucie
git commit -m "Added liblucie"

You can use make -C liblucie, inside your Makefile to compile the library.
Be sure to pass your variables to have the excepted results.

Alternatively you can just compile from the liblucie folder.

I recommend enabling optimizations & linking time optimizations.

This library is mantained by my free time, and I might or not break the API.
So please be aware of it, since it's open source,
you can easily use git to roll your branch version if needed.
