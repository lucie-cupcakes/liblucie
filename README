C Library for my projects.

Read the file lucie_lib.h for definitions and documentation about each function.

For including it in your project, you can simply copy and paste the files lucie_lib.h and lucie_lib.c,
or run the make command for generating an object file.

I recommend enabling optimizations & linking time optimizations.
